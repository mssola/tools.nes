;; explanations on each section on how an NES game is initialized and stored.

;;;
;; The iNES is the de facto standard for the distribution of NES binary programs
;; and it's compatible with the format used by NES cartridges themselves (used,
;; even, by the Wii Virtual Console). The layout is composed by segments in
;; memory, which are defined with the `.segment` macro and known by the compiler
;; through a linker configuration. You can provide a configuration of your own,
;; but bear in mind that compilers like `cc65` (the one used here, which is the
;; most common) already provide a default configuration for the linker that
;; glues a set of pretty common defined named segments. You can read about this
;; in `cfg/nes.cfg` from inside your cc65 installation. Otherwise, I have also
;; written linker configuration files for other examples: take a look, for
;; instance, at the `config/unrom.cfg` file, which is used by the
;; `basics/unrom.s` program.
;;;

;;;
;; The "HEADER" is the first segment of any iNES binary and it contains basic
;; information about what this "cartridge" requires in order to work. Besides
;; basic identification, it defines some relevant things like PRG and CHR sizes,
;; plus mapping if desired. See https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/NES_2.0#Header for
;; documentation on this, or also: https://www.nesdev.org/neshdr20.txt.
;;;
.segment "HEADER"
    ;; The first thing to do is to define the magic "NES\0" string identifier
    ;; ($1A is the ASCII that MS-DOS wanted as end of string). Some people write
    ;; it in hexadecimal through and through, but cc65 already compiles
    ;; characters into their proper hexadecimal values, so there's no need to be
    ;; extra cryptic here.
    .byte 'N', 'E', 'S', $1A

    ;; The next two bytes define the size of the PRG and CHR ROMs in this order.
    ;; Hence, the next two bytes define a 32KB (2 x 16KB) of PRG-ROM, and 8KB
    ;; (1 x 8KB) of CHR-ROM.
    .byte $02
    .byte $01

    ;; Next we have two bytes for selecting a mapper. This is a huge topic (see
    ;; the NesDev wiki for this), but it basically refers to the fact that some
    ;; cartridges had specific requirements on how to place their data, or the
    ;; amount of it they required, or how they expected their data to be
    ;; mirrored in the memory, etc. During the life-time of the NES, and as
    ;; developers pushed the boundaries of the NES hardware, more intricate
    ;; mappers were used on the hardware of cartridges themselves. Thus, in
    ;; these two bytes we are telling the emulator: "hey, act as if this was a
    ;; cartridge that used this kind of mapper".
    .byte $00                   ; Horizontal mirroring (good for vertical scrollers)
    .byte $00                   ; No mapper nor special-case flags.

    ;; The previous are the mandatory bytes in order to get a "cartridge" going.
    ;; After this there are some other bytes you can put into the header, like
    ;; specifying the region (NTSC vs PAL), but for now this falls out of my
    ;; radar :-)

;;;
;; This is the segment where we tell the processor where to find the code for
;; three important topics: the Non-Maskable Interrupts handler, the Reset
;; handler, and the IRQ handler. If you look at the configuration from `cc65`
;; that was provided on your installation (or if you are pesky enough to create
;; one yourself), you will notice that these vector addresses are placed at the
;; very end of memory ($fffa-ffff). The NES (and emulators) will look at these
;; three last positions in memory to know where to jump for each case.
;;;
.segment "VECTORS"
    .addr nmi
    .addr reset
    .addr irq

.segment "CODE"

;;;
;; The Reset handler is executed when the whole thing starts (i.e. the user has
;; pressed either the reset or the power on buttons on the NES). Thus, this
;; piece of code is pretty standard and an implementation is even given in the
;; NesDev wiki which is pretty much followed by everyone as I could see. The
;; main idea is to leave the hardware in a known state and then jump into the
;; main game subroutine.
;;;
reset:
    ;; We first instruct the NES to disable everything. That is, we don't want
    ;; any pesky interrupt to make us jump into the `nmi` section, for example,
    ;; before we have configured everything.

    ;; Ignore IRQs and disable decimal mode (the NES 6502 chip, for copyright
    ;; issues or legal reasons against MOS that I don't fully know nor care,
    ;; does not have decimal mode anyway, but it's considered good practice).
    sei
    cld

    ;; Disable APU frame IRQ. This is the first instance we see of Memory-Mapped
    ;; I/O. This is a core concept in NES programming and, to sum things up, the
    ;; memory range $2000-$6000 is reserved to I/O operations, and each address
    ;; is reserved to a specific hardware operation. This is because the NES CPU
    ;; doesn't directly control the PPU nor other chips. In this case, ranges
    ;; $4000-$4017 control the APU (Audio Processing Unit). More precisely, the
    ;; $4017 address controls what is called the "Frame counter" from the APU
    ;; (https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/APU#Frame_Counter_($4017)). Setting #$40 to
    ;; it disables it completely, so we are in a known state. If we were to use
    ;; sound, at the end of the reset code we should enable it back. We do *not*
    ;; do it here because we don't need it.
    ldx #$40
    stx $4017                   ; APU Frame Counter

    ;; Set up the stack register with the proper value (the stack will grow in
    ;; decreasing order from $01FF -> $0100).
    ldx #$ff
    txs

    ;; And now disable, in this order, NMI, rendering and DMC IRQs. Note that
    ;; `x` was set to $ff, so increasing it by one results in a zero, which is
    ;; the value then stored in the aforementioned memory locations.
    ;;
    ;; The one on $4010 refers again to the APU (as described before), and it
    ;; directly controls the DMC. Again, if you wanted sound, you should enable
    ;; this back after the whole reset block.
    ;;
    ;; On the other side, the low addresses of $2000 control the PPU. In
    ;; particular, we disable NMIs from the PPU by setting the PPUCTRL address
    ;; ($2000) to zero, and we do the same for the PPUMASK ($2001). Don't worry
    ;; about them just now, we will go deeper down below.
    inx
    stx $2000                   ; PPUCTRL
    stx $2001                   ; PPUMASK
    stx $4010                   ; APU DMC

    ;;;
    ;; NOTE: If you are using a mapper which needs some special configuration,
    ;; now it would be a good time set it up. I am not using a special mapper,
    ;; so there's nothing from me to do here.
    ;;;

    ;; At this point, we have to wait for the PPU to stabilize. This is
    ;; typically done by checking a flag from the PPUSTATUS address ($2002) and
    ;; waiting until the proper value is set by the PPU. Since this wait can
    ;; take a while, programmers typically put other initialization code here,
    ;; like sprite resetting and such.
    ;;
    ;; The PPUSTATUS memory address contains general information on the status
    ;; of the PPU, and is read-only. Moreover, reading from the PPUSTATUS has a
    ;; convenient side-effect: it resets the "address latch" for PPUADDR. We
    ;; will see how we can take advantage of this when we use the PPU properly
    ;; down the road.

    ;; First of the two waits.
@vblankwait1:
    bit $2002                   ; PPUSTATUS

    ;; The PPU has at least started, now we have a bunch of cycles for it to
    ;; stabilize, which will be properly announced through the PPUSTATUS memory
    ;; address. Instead of just waiting for it again, we will take the chance to
    ;; initialize more stuff.

    ;; One typical thing to do is to leave the RAM in a known state. That is, we
    ;; will set to 0 addresses $0000 - $07FF. Apparently there are some people
    ;; who say that doing this is bad because it will hide programming mistakes
    ;; (e.g. bad initialization code). So, if you are one of these people, you
    ;; can safely remove this loop. Otherwise let's get the RAM clean. That
    ;; being said, notice that we are skipping $200-$2ff. This is no mistake as
    ;; you will see below.

    inx
    bne @ram_reset_loop         ; if x overflows back to #00, then we are done.

    ;; And now another thing we can do is to reset the sprites. We will reserve
    ;; space for sprites in $0200-02ff (the range we did not initialize when
    ;; cleaning up RAM). With this in mind we will perform a DMA process right
    ;; after this block of code that will take this memory range and bulk it
    ;; into PPU OAM space.
    ;;
    ;; "Resetting sprites" is just a matter of giving them a value which will
    ;; not bother us in the future. One way to do this is to set each value to
    ;; $ef, which will give each "sprite" off-screen Y-coordinates. How any of
    ;; this is the case will be shown whenever we deal with loading proper
    ;; sprites below.
    lda #$ef
@sprite_reset_loop:
    sta $200, x
    inx
    bne @sprite_reset_loop

    ;; And write these resetted "sprites" into the PPU. How does this work?
    ;; Well, address $2003 has the OAMADDR. That is, from which position the PPU
    ;; should start the DMA process. In our case we set it to the very
    ;; beginning. Then, if you write to the OAMDMA memory address ($4014), you
    ;; will instruct the PPU to start a DMA process starting at $1XX*N. XX is
    ;; the byte given at the OAMADDR, thus XX = #$00; and N = 2 (see `lda
    ;; #$02`). Therefore, we are telling the PPU to start the DMA process from
    ;; $200. The PPU will assume that the following 256 bytes of memory are the
    ;; ones to be copied, resulting in a DMA copy of $200-$2ff, right where we
    ;; stored the sprite data in advance.

    ;; And we also reset the palettes. How is this done? Well, the $2006 memory
    ;; address is the PPU address (PPUADDR). This address is given byte by byte,
    ;; the most significat byte first. Thus, the four lines below store into
    ;; $2006 the value $3F00. This is the first address where palettes are
    ;; stored. Palettes are the answer from old systems like the NES to: how can
    ;; you display this amount of colors on screen without taking too much
    ;; memory? The NES allows developers to store eight palettes (four
    ;; background, four foreground), and each palette group four colors. This
    ;; way, whenever we want to draw a sprite or a piece of background, we don't
    ;; specify which colors to pick for each pixel, but we rather apply a
    ;; palette to a sprite or background tile definition.
    lda #$3F

    ;; After setting the address for the first palette, now we loop #$20 times:
    ;; 8 palettes * 4 bytes per palette (1 byte per color) = 32 (#$20
    ;; hexadecimal). At each iteration we will write into $2007 the value #$0F.
    ;; This memory address is the PPUDATA, and #$0F corresponds to a black
    ;; color. In each iteration, therefore, we are telling the PPU that we want
    ;; a black color for all the colors from all palettes. Moreover, whenever
    ;; you write into PPUDATA, the memory address for the next store is
    ;; incremented by one automatically. This is why we don't have to index the
    ;; write or anything like that, but we can simply write to the same memory
    ;; address 32 times and it will be performed onto 32 consecutive positions.

    ;;     - 4: background pattern table starts at $1000. The CHR is divided by
    ;;          two pattern tables, and each table contains 256 8x8 tiles. In my
    ;;          case, my sprite data is located at the first pattern table (thus
    ;;          $0000, and that's why the 3rd bit from PPUCTRL is set to zero),
    ;;          and the background data is on the second pattern table (that
    ;;          starting at $1000). In the end this all depends on how you want
    ;;          to structure your CHR file.
    ;;     - 5: sprite size is 8x16. Set this to 0 if your sprites in the
    ;;          character file are 8x8.
    ;;     - 7: allow a NMI at the start of the vertical blanking interval.
    ;;          That is, whenever the screen has displayed one frame, send us
    ;;          an interrupt so we can generate the next one (see the code on
    ;;          `nmi`).
    ;;   - PPUMASK: we enable 4 bits:
    ;;     - 1: Show background in leftmost pixels on the screen.
    ;;     - 2: Show sprites in leftmost pixels on the screen.
    ;;     - 3: Show background.

    ;; the PPU where to put each item and where to find it on the pattern table.
    ;; After that, we can change/toggle the palette for a background tile if we
    ;; so want it, and we are done with it.

    ;; Anyways, before loading data into the PPU, we always have to check the
    ;; PPUSTATUS, that's why the first instruction of each block is a `bit
    ;; $2002`. This is a safe-guard so to reset the "address latch". That is, if
    ;; instead of writing two consecutive bytes we only wrote one by mistake (or
    ;; because we only wanted to write the high byte), it resets back its
    ;; internal index.

    ;; Load the first item for the background! Let's make sense of the values.
    ;;
    ;; We first need to set the address that the PPU will use (that is, which
    ;; couple of bytes we need to pass to PPUADDR). That is: which tile index is
    ;; to be used from the nametable (read more about PPU Nametables here:
    ;; https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/PPU_nametables). Think of this as the screen
    ;; being set as a grid of 8x8 pixels (tile), and each of these tiles is
    ;; indexed in PPU memory: 960 bytes of actual data, and 64 bytes for the
    ;; attribute table (see more on attribute tables below). You can draw this
    ;; by hand by using resources like Morhpcat's developer spreadsheet
    ;; (https://ko-fi.com/s/ad5d7601e0), based on the ones being used at
    ;; Nintendo. This is good but there are also handy tools that make things
    ;; easier for us. For example the NEXXT tool allows users to draw a full NES
    ;; screen and then it gives the offset address that you can use for each
    ;; drawn element. I did this and I got that the offset for the first element
    ;; was $0C8, which added to the base address of $2000 (start of the first
    ;; nametable), gave me the address $20C8. If you want to make more sense of
    ;; it by just reading the number, notice that each row has exactly 32 tiles.
    ;; Thus, you can divide 0x0C8 by 32 and you will get 6.25: that is, on the
    ;; vertical axis it's the row '6'. Then subtract 0xC8 by 192 (6 rows of 32
    ;; tiles) to get '8' as the value on the horizontal axis. As you can see,
    ;; doing things manually can be tedious, that's why people either use a dev
    ;; spreadsheet or a computer assisted tool.
    ;;
    ;; Anyways, if I want this background element to be rendered in the position
    ;; I envisioned on this tool, I need to write $20C8 into PPUADDR, which adds
    ;; for a total of two bytes to be loaded for operations that only support
    ;; one byte at a time. Hence, we have to load byte by byte (in little-endian
    ;; format) and store them. As for the PPUDATA address, I need to pass #$02
    ;; because that's the index inside of the CHR file of the star in the second
    ;; pattern table (check the PPUCTRL setting at the end of the `main`
    ;; function on why it's the second pattern table). You can check that by
    ;; opening the `.chr` file for this example on YY-CHR.

    ;; Now we have to do the same for the rest of the elements. I have gone

    ;; NEXXT and here's the result. Instead of repeating te same code over and

    ;; background screen as defined on that specific nametable. Information on
    ;; this is also given to us by tools like NEXXT. Shortly, for one of the
    ;; elements I want to change their palette I was told that the "attribute
    ;; offset" was $03CE. Again, added to the base address, it means that we
    ;; need to pass $23CE to the PPUADDR. The value for PPUDATA is a bit more
    ;; tricky: on the attribute table each 8x8 tile is broken down into 4
    ;; 2-sized squares. Each of these 4 squares of the tile has a palette
    ;; assigned to it ($00 by default). Thanks to this setup, a single byte can
    ;; encode four palettes by addressing each square: %44332211. The tool also
    ;; tells us in which of these smaller squares our element resides. With this
    ;; info, and since we have two bits available for each of these smaller
    ;; squares and, therefore, can encode up to 4 palettes, it means that we
    ;; just have to assign either on the range of 00-11 to the pair of bits
    ;; representing the smaller square that NEXXT is telling us that our
    ;; background element resides in. In this case it's the first square, so we
    ;; just need to assign $01 to the bits reserved to this square if I want to
    ;; change the palette to 1. This is what we pass as a value.
