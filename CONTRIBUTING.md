This project uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), so use the usual
[cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) commands in order to build and run the
desired binaries/tests.

## Issue reporting

I'm using Github in order to host the code. Thus, in order to report issues you
can do it on its [issue tracker](https://github.com/mssola/ntools/issues). A
couple of notes on reports:

- Check that the issue has not already been reported or fixed in the `main`
  branch.
- Try to be concise and precise in your description of the problem.
- Provide a step by step guide on how to reproduce this problem.
- Provide the version you are using (git commit SHA).

## Pull requests

- Write a [good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Run the tests (`cargo test`).
- Update the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).
- Open a pull request with *only* one subject and a clear title and description.
  Refrain from submitting pull requests with tons of different unrelated
  commits.
